#Project 8

1. In this project, we used JavaScript and WebDriverIO to run automated tests for the Urban Routes web app

2. To install the project locally you must run these commands within GitBash:

*  * cd ~               # make sure you're in your home directory
 * mkdir projects     # create a folder called projects
 * cd projects        # change directory into the new projects folder

3. Then you must clone the repo from GitHub using one of the following commands:
 
*  if you are using HTTPS
 git clone https://github.com/username/hm08-qa-us.git

4. Next, you must run "npm install" from the console in your project folder

5. To work on the project, open VS Code, select File>Open Folder, then select the hm08-qa-us folder that you cloned to your computer

6. In wdio.conf.js, replace the base URL with the  Urban Routes URL generated.

7. Type your main tests in the page.js file, then call them when running them within the creatingAnOrder.js file

8. To execute each test, run the "npm run wdio" command in the terminal
